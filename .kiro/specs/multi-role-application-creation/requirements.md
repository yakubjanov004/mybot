# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables multiple user roles (Manager, Junior Manager, Controller, Call Center) to create applications on behalf of clients. Currently, only clients can create their own applications through the bot. This enhancement will allow authorized staff members to create both "Connection Request" (Ulanish uchun ariza) and "Technical Service" (Texnik xizmat) applications for clients, streamlining the application process and improving customer service efficiency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Manager, I want to create both connection requests and technical service applications for clients, so that I can provide comprehensive customer service and handle applications on behalf of clients who may need assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Manager accesses the main menu THEN the system SHALL display both "ðŸ”Œ Ulanish uchun ariza" and "ðŸ”§ Texnik xizmat" buttons
2. WHEN a Manager selects either application type THEN the system SHALL guide them through the same application creation process as clients
3. WHEN a Manager completes an application THEN the system SHALL create the application with the Manager as the creator but assign it to the specified client
4. WHEN an application is created by a Manager THEN the system SHALL notify the client about the application created on their behalf
5. WHEN viewing applications THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which applications were created by staff members vs. self-created by clients

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Junior Manager, I want to create connection request applications for clients, so that I can assist clients with connectivity issues and handle their requests efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Junior Manager accesses the main menu THEN the system SHALL display the "ðŸ”Œ Ulanish uchun ariza" button
2. WHEN a Junior Manager selects connection request THEN the system SHALL guide them through the connection request creation process
3. WHEN a Junior Manager completes a connection request THEN the system SHALL create the application and route it through the normal workflow
4. WHEN a connection request is created by a Junior Manager THEN the system SHALL notify the client and relevant staff members
5. IF a Junior Manager tries to access technical service creation THEN the system SHALL deny access with appropriate message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Controller, I want to create both connection requests and technical service applications for clients, so that I can handle escalated cases and provide direct customer support when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Controller accesses the main menu THEN the system SHALL display both "ðŸ”Œ Ulanish uchun ariza" and "ðŸ”§ Texnik xizmat" buttons
2. WHEN a Controller selects either application type THEN the system SHALL guide them through the application creation process
3. WHEN a Controller completes an application THEN the system SHALL create the application with proper workflow routing
4. WHEN an application is created by a Controller THEN the system SHALL track the Controller as the creator for audit purposes
5. WHEN a Controller creates a technical service request THEN the system SHALL allow direct assignment to available technicians

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Call Center operator, I want to create both connection requests and technical service applications for clients, so that I can handle phone inquiries and create applications during customer calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Call Center operator accesses the main menu THEN the system SHALL display both "ðŸ”Œ Ulanish uchun ariza" and "ðŸ”§ Texnik xizmat" buttons
2. WHEN a Call Center operator selects either application type THEN the system SHALL guide them through the application creation process
3. WHEN a Call Center operator completes an application THEN the system SHALL create the application and route it appropriately
4. WHEN an application is created by a Call Center operator THEN the system SHALL log the call center interaction for quality assurance
5. WHEN a Call Center operator creates an application THEN the system SHALL allow immediate client notification via phone or message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a client, I want to be notified when staff members create applications on my behalf, so that I am aware of all applications associated with my account and can track their progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN staff creates an application on behalf of a client THEN the system SHALL send an immediate notification to the client
2. WHEN a client views their applications THEN the system SHALL show all applications including those created by staff
3. WHEN displaying staff-created applications THEN the system SHALL indicate who created the application and when
4. WHEN a client receives a notification about a staff-created application THEN the notification SHALL include application details and next steps
5. IF a client wants to modify a staff-created application THEN the system SHALL allow modifications through the normal process

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to track which staff members create applications and monitor application creation patterns, so that I can ensure proper usage and identify training needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any staff member creates an application THEN the system SHALL log the creator's role, ID, and timestamp
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include statistics on staff-created vs. client-created applications
3. WHEN viewing application details THEN the system SHALL display the creator information for audit purposes
4. WHEN analyzing application patterns THEN the system SHALL provide insights on which roles create which types of applications
5. WHEN detecting unusual application creation patterns THEN the system SHALL generate alerts for review

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a staff member creating applications, I want the interface to be intuitive and consistent with the client experience, so that I can efficiently create applications without extensive training.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN staff members access application creation THEN the system SHALL use the same interface flow as client application creation
2. WHEN staff members create applications THEN the system SHALL support both Uzbek and Russian languages
3. WHEN staff members complete application forms THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields before submission
4. WHEN staff members encounter errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and guidance
5. WHEN staff members create applications THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation of successful creation with application ID

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a workflow participant, I want staff-created applications to follow the same workflow processes as client-created applications, so that all applications receive consistent handling and processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN staff creates a connection request THEN the system SHALL route it through the standard connection workflow (Manager â†’ Junior Manager â†’ Controller â†’ Technician â†’ Warehouse)
2. WHEN staff creates a technical service request THEN the system SHALL route it through the standard technical service workflow
3. WHEN processing staff-created applications THEN the system SHALL apply the same business rules and validations
4. WHEN staff-created applications reach completion THEN the system SHALL follow the same feedback and rating processes
5. WHEN staff-created applications encounter issues THEN the system SHALL use the same error handling and escalation procedures

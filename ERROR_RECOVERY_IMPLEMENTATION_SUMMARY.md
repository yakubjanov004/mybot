## System Integration

### Initialization
The comprehensive error recovery system is initialized in the main application loader and integrates with:
- Existing state management system
- Notification system
- Inventory management system
- Workflow engine
- Admin interface

### Background Processes
The system runs several background processes:
- **Retry Processing**: Processes notification retry queue every minute
- **Inventory Reconciliation**: Runs hourly to detect and fix discrepancies
- **Stuck Workflow Detection**: Checks every 30 minutes for stuck workflows
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous system health tracking

### Error Recovery Flow
1. **Error Detection**: Errors are caught by enhanced middleware
2. **Error Categorization**: Automatic categorization based on error type and context
3. **Error Handling**: Category-specific handling with appropriate recovery actions

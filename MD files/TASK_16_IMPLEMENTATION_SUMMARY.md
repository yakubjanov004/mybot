## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Statistics
```python
from utils.application_tracker import application_tracker, ApplicationSource

# Get overall statistics
stats = await application_tracker.get_application_statistics(30)
print(f"Staff created: {stats.staff_creation_percentage:.1f}%")

# Get staff vs client comparison
comparison = await application_tracker.generate_comparison_report(30)
print(f"Insights: {comparison.insights}")
```

### Generate Reports
```python
from utils.admin_reporting import admin_reporting, ReportRequest, ReportFormat

# Generate performance report
request = ReportRequest(
    report_type='performance_analysis',
    period='weekly',
    format_type=ReportFormat.JSON.value
)
report = await admin_reporting.generate_performance_report(request)
```

### Configure Alerts
```python
from utils.application_alerts import alert_system, AlertRule

# Add custom alert rule
rule = AlertRule(
    rule_id="custom_alert",
    name="Custom Alert",
    alert_type="custom_type",
    threshold_config={"threshold": 50},
    frequency="daily",
    channels=["telegram"],
    recipients=[admin_user_id]
)
await alert_system.add_alert_rule(rule)
```

- **Test Coverage**: `test_manager_created_connection_request_workflow()`
- **Verification**: Complete Manager-created connection request workflow from creation to client rating
- **Workflow Steps Tested**:
  1. Manager creates connection request via staff handler
  2. Manager assigns to Junior Manager
  3. Junior Manager calls client and forwards to Controller
  4. Controller assigns to Technician
  5. Technician completes installation and documents equipment
  6. Warehouse updates inventory and closes request
  7. Client rates the service

### ‚úÖ Requirement 8.2: Staff-created technical service requests follow standard workflow
- **Test Coverage**: `test_call_center_created_technical_service_complete_workflow()`
- **Verification**: Complete Call Center-created technical service workflow

  - Feedback system works identically for both types of applications

### ‚úÖ Requirement 8.5: Same error handling and escalation procedures
- **Test Coverage**: 
  - `test_error_handling_for_staff_created_applications()`
